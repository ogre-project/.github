# About

These days, data drives so much of our experiences, and things are no different 
when it comes to the games that we play. Apps, websites, software, virtual 
table-tops and more all rely on game rules, facts and figures - raw data.

This project exists to encourage the collaboration of individuals interested in 
the creation, distribution and usage of open source data for games, including 
board games, card games, roleplaying games, tabletop miniature games, video 
games and more.
